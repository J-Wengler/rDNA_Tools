# About

Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) represents a crucial component of the genome, fundamental to cellular homeostasis, protein synthesis, and development. The regulation and maintenance of rDNA have garnered significant interest in basic and translational research, particularly as modifications in rDNA structure and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and aging. Advances in computational techniques have revolutionized our understanding of molecular biology, enabling the comprehensive analysis of various DNA and RNA sequences and modifications. However, the unique structural features of rDNA lead to challenges in single-base resolution analysis of rDNA modifications. Attempts to overcome these obstacles have led to several methods to evaluate rDNA at a single-base resolution. This repository contains simple scripts designed to be used by researchers with limited computational knowledge map reads to either an rDNA-specific sequence or combined genome.
